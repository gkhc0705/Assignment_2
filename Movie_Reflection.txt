Task 3: Reflections on the movie Revolution OS

1. What was the point made by Bill gates in his Open Letter to Hobbyists?

Answer: We need a good software and its owner who understands the programming 
        for a hobby computer to not be wasted. Most of hobbyists must be aware
        that most of you steal your software.


2. What did Richard Stallman describe as an ethical dilemma?
   
Answer: Stallman states that free software is "important for quality of life 
        and the good of the society". The developers of the system didn't share
        the program with other people, but instead they tried to control the 
        users. In order to use it, you needed to sign a contract to assure that
        it won't be shared with anybody else. However, he didn't want it to be   
        this way and didn't want to feel like betraying the rest of the world.


3. What are the freedoms that enable people to form a community?

Answer: The freedom to make changes if you want to hire someone or to hire someone 
        for them to make changes for you. If you're using a software for your own
        business, to redistribute the copies, to share with other people and as well
        as to make some improvements before publishing them. All of these things are
        for other people to get access to the program and benefit from it.
